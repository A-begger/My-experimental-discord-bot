# My-experimental-discord-bot
This is my experimental bot, for now it only has 2 commads.
-status and -ping, -status is used to view the status of a mc server you would like and -ping is to see if the bot is still working (bot replies with Pong!)
I do plan to add more features so be patient with me!
